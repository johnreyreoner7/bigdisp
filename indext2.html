			<h2>Analytics Reports</h2>
			<p>Our analytics report provides information on the rice production, importation, prices and challenges.</p>

				<p>Production: The rice production from 2012 to 2021 is fairly fluid with a total of 187.63 metric tons of rice that is produced in 10 years.</p>
				<p>Imports and exports: The rice exports from 2012 to 2021 was not great in number with 2013 is the highest revenue of rice export with 5,358,550 USD in that year but it goes down so much in 2015 to 2021. In 2020 Philippines exported rice to United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Qatar and United States. In rice imports from 2012 to 2021 is so high that 2021 has 1,196,910,000 USD. In 2020 alone we imported from Vietnam, Burma, China, Thailand and India.</p>
				<p>Consumption and demand: The consumption of rice from 2012 to 2021 was good although rice is high in demand the production of rice per metric tons is more than the consumption per metric tons of the people here in the Philippines.</p>
				<p>Prices and market trends: The government buys palay in average farmgate price for 17.68 Php per kilogram. This was the price of palay in last quarter of 2022. The huge factor for influencing the price movement of rice was the supply and demand of it, Income and population in the Philippines.</p>
				<p>Government policies and Initiatives: The main source of assistance for Filipino manufacturers is market price support (MPS), which reflects the country's trade restrictions (primarily tariffs and Tariff Rate Quotas - TRQs). The primary beneficiaries of price support schemes are rice producers. Together with rice, significant amounts of support are given to sugarcane, pig meat, and poultry, especially through high import taxes. Due to the high MPS, main consumers, such as the food processing sector, are implicitly taxed.
					The ratio of general service expenditures (GSSE) to agricultural value added has risen recently. The majority of general service spending goes into extension programs and the improvement of infrastructure, particularly irrigation systems. In 2017–19, the total cost of assistance provided to the Philippine agriculture sector amounted to 2.9% of GDP, ranking it as one of the highest costs among all countries studied.</p>
				<p>Challenges: Many Filipino farmers are simply unable to take their production further due to the high expense of many critical inputs. Compounding this is the low palay prices that could be expected after harvesting, which keeps many farmers in a perpetual state of struggle and often in serious debt. Climate change is causing seasonal typhoons to happen more frequently and with more ferocity while leading to dry seasons with unheard-of high temperatures. Both of these situations are damaging enough for most farms’ productivity. However, the negative effects of climate change do not stop there. The market for rice has changed much over the past generation. Not only are cheaper imports from Vietnam and other Asian countries pricing Filipino farmers out, but domestic rice consumption has also been dropping slowly over the past few decades. Fewer and fewer farmers want their children to have the life that they do. As a result, most of them do everything they can to ensure their children get better-paying jobs, often in the cities. As a result, the average age of Filipino farmers is 53, as few younger people are willing to take up farming. This means that productivity per farmer can be expected to fall, especially for such physically demanding crops as rice.</p>

			<p>Rice that is imported or exported from the Philippines.</p>
			<div class="trend-importexport">
				<h4>Rice Import</h4>
				<p>According to the data from the Philippne Statics Authority (PSA), these are the most imported rice in the Philippines</p>
				<p>1. Indica rice - This is a variety of long-grain rice that is commonly grown in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and India. In 2020, it was the most imported rice variety in the Philippines, accounting for 73.14% of total rice imports.</p>

				<div id="piechart_3ds" class="piechart_3ds"></div>

				<h4 class="h4pading">Rice Export</h4>

				<p>The Philippines is not a major exporter of rice, as it typically imports more rice than it produces. In fact, the country has been a net rice importer since the 1990s. While there may be some limited export of rice varieties, it is not a significant contributor to the country's economy. The country's rice production is mainly used to meet domestic demand. Therefore, there are no significant exports of rice from the Philippines, and the country's rice imports generally exceed its exports.</p>
