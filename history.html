                <h1>BIGDISP: A Raspberry-Based Smart Rice Dispenser Machine with Cashand Cashless Payment System</h1>
                <p>We are the group that proposes BIGDISP: A Raspberry-Based Smart Rice Dispenser Machine with Cash and Cashless 
                    Payment System, this was a requirement for our bachelors degree in Computer Engineering, we propose this protoype 
                    since rice was abundant in our country, rice is in our food culture for a long time now a normal filipino family always have 
                    rice in the table everytime they eat. Since rice is a rich source of carbohydrates, the bodyâ€™s main fuel source. Carbohydrates 
                    can keep you energized and satisfied, and are important for fueling exercise (Tae Park, 2020). Rice is the second largest 
                    crop in planting acreage after wheat. Global rice production was 596.5 million tons from 155 million hectares (ha) in 1999. 
                    The major rice growing regions are found in more than a hundred countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. 
                    About 85 percent of total rice production is for human consumption. Rice provides 23 percent of the global human 
                    per capita energy and 16 percent of the per capita protein (IRRI, 1997). </p>

            <div class="group-intro">
                <p>We take inspiration to existing dispensers and vending machines that already existed now. Like a rice dispenser that is not a 
                    necessarily be in the kitchen but it helps us to have a accurate measurement and it is conevenient for us because it does a
                    good job for despensing rice with a push of a button only. As you know rice dipensers are good for grain storation, it lessen the
                    worries about dust, bugs or moisture getting into the rice and are designed to be filled up from the top and to dispense rice from
                    the bottom. This helps to ensue that the old batch of rice is the first to go out before you start using new rice that you have
                    purchased. Since rice dispensers works as a storage of rice you will get a good capacity for you to store the rice. As we said
                    this machine acts like a vending machine so that people buy from it without interaction with other people since it is a vending 
                    machine that provides items to the people with a rice that is being sold, this can be coin and bill operated vending machines, 
                    also this can be operated also by an cashless payment but for now we only use gcash for its payment system since gcash is
                    the most abundant digital money that is used.</p>

                <div class="cash-cashless">
                    <p>Cash and cashless payment are two distinct modes of payment that have become an integral part of our lives. Cash payment involves the use of physical currency notes or coins to make purchases, while cashless payment refers to transactions made through electronic means, such as credit cards, mobile payments, and online banking. Both forms of payment have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on individual preferences and circumstances.

                        One of the main advantages of cash payment is its convenience. It is universally accepted, requires no special equipment, and is easy to use. Cash transactions are also faster than cashless ones since they do not require any verification or authorization. Moreover, cash payment is ideal for small purchases, as it eliminates the need to carry a credit card or other forms of electronic payment.
                        
                        However, cash payment also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is that it is not always safe. Carrying large amounts of cash can be risky, especially in areas where crime rates are high. Additionally, cash payment can be inconvenient in situations where exact change is required, or the amount being paid is significant.
                        
                        On the other hand, cashless payment offers several benefits. It is more secure than cash payment since it eliminates the risk of theft or loss. Cashless payment is also convenient, especially for online transactions, where physical presence is not required. It is also faster than cash payment since it requires minimal time for verification and authorization.
                        
                        However, cashless payment has its own set of challenges. One of the main concerns with electronic payment is security. Hackers can target payment systems and steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, causing significant financial losses. Additionally, not all merchants accept electronic payment, and some may impose additional charges on transactions made through credit cards.
                        
                        In conclusion, both cash and cashless payment have their advantages and disadvantages. While cash payment is convenient and widely accepted, it is not always safe and can be inconvenient in certain situations. Cashless payment, on the other hand, is more secure and faster but can be challenging in terms of security and merchant acceptance. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences and circumstances, and it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.</p>

                <div class="pandemic">
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in the way we live our lives, including the way we purchase goods and services. With social distancing protocols and restrictions on public gatherings, many businesses have had to adapt to new ways of conducting transactions, including vending machines.

                        Vending machines have played a crucial role during the pandemic as they provide a contactless and convenient way for customers to purchase products. They offer an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores, which may have limited hours or may be closed altogether due to the pandemic.
                        
                        One of the key advantages of vending machines during the pandemic is their contactless nature. Unlike traditional retail stores, vending machines do not require human interaction, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of the virus. Many vending machines now feature touchless payment options, such as mobile payments, credit cards, or contactless cards, further reducing the risk of transmission.
                        
                        Another advantage of vending machines during the pandemic is their convenience. Vending machines are located in many public areas, such as train stations, airports, hospitals, and schools, making them easily accessible to people who need essential items quickly. They also offer 24-hour service, which is particularly useful for people who work night shifts or those who have to run errands outside regular business hours.
                        
                        Furthermore, vending machines have played a critical role in ensuring the availability of essential items, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, and hand sanitizers. As the demand for these items skyrocketed during the pandemic, vending machines helped to ensure that they were easily accessible to the public. Some vending machines even offer health-related items, such as vitamins and over-the-counter medicines, further promoting public health.
                        
                        In conclusion, vending machines have played a vital role during the COVID-19 pandemic. They offer a convenient and contactless way for customers to purchase goods, reducing the risk of transmission. They also ensure the availability of essential items and promote public health. As the pandemic continues to reshape our lives, vending machines are likely to become even more critical in the future.</p>
